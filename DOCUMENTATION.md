## Project Overview

The Notes App API is a secure RESTful web service designed for personal note management. This application provides a comprehensive backend solution that enables users to create, read, update, and delete personal notes while ensuring data privacy and security through robust authentication mechanisms.

### Key Features

The application implements several core functionalities that make it a complete note management solution. User registration and authentication form the foundation of the system, allowing individuals to create secure accounts and access their personal data. The JWT-based authentication system ensures that each user can only access their own notes, providing complete data isolation and privacy protection.

The CRUD operations are implemented with full REST compliance, offering intuitive endpoints for managing notes. Users can create new notes with titles and content, retrieve all their notes or specific individual notes, update existing notes with new information, and delete notes they no longer need. Each operation is protected by authentication middleware, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access or manipulate data.

### Business Value

This application addresses the common need for secure, personal note-taking and organization. In today's digital world, individuals require reliable systems to store thoughts, ideas, reminders, and important information. The API provides a foundation that can be extended with web or mobile frontends, making it a versatile solution for various note-taking applications.

The security-first approach ensures that sensitive personal information remains protected, while the RESTful design makes it easy to integrate with different client applications. The modular architecture allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements, making it suitable for both personal projects and commercial applications.

## Architecture and Design

### System Architecture

The Notes App API follows a layered architecture pattern that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The application is structured into several distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities and clear interfaces.

The presentation layer consists of FastAPI route handlers that manage HTTP requests and responses. These handlers are responsible for request validation, authentication verification, and response formatting. They serve as the interface between external clients and the business logic layer.

The business logic layer contains the core application functionality, including user management, note operations, and security enforcement. This layer implements the business rules and ensures data consistency across operations. It acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the data access layer.

The data access layer manages all database interactions through SQLite connections. This layer abstracts database operations and provides a clean interface for data manipulation. The use of raw SQL queries with proper parameterization ensures both performance and security.

### Design Patterns

The application implements several design patterns to ensure code quality and maintainability. The Dependency Injection pattern is used extensively through FastAPI's dependency system, particularly for authentication and database connections. This approach promotes loose coupling and makes testing easier.

The Repository pattern is implicitly implemented through the database access functions, providing a consistent interface for data operations. This pattern allows for easy database technology changes in the future without affecting the business logic.

The Middleware pattern is utilized for cross-cutting concerns such as CORS handling and authentication. This approach ensures that common functionality is applied consistently across all endpoints without code duplication.

### Security Architecture

Security is implemented through multiple layers to ensure comprehensive protection. The authentication layer uses JWT tokens with configurable expiration times, providing stateless authentication that scales well. Password security is ensured through bcrypt hashing with salt generation, protecting against rainbow table attacks.

Access control is implemented at the endpoint level, with middleware verifying user identity and ownership of resources. This ensures that users can only access and modify their own data, providing complete data isolation.

The database layer implements parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, while input validation at the API level prevents malformed data from entering the system.

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework

FastAPI serves as the core framework for this application, chosen for its modern Python features, automatic API documentation generation, and excellent performance characteristics. FastAPI provides built-in support for data validation through Pydantic models, automatic OpenAPI schema generation, and asynchronous request handling.

The framework's dependency injection system simplifies authentication implementation and promotes clean code architecture. Its automatic documentation generation creates interactive API documentation that aids in development and testing.

### Database Technology

SQLite is used as the database engine, providing a lightweight, serverless database solution that's perfect for development and small to medium-scale deployments. SQLite offers ACID compliance, ensuring data integrity, while requiring no separate database server installation or configuration.

The choice of SQLite makes the application highly portable and easy to deploy, as the entire database is contained in a single file. For production deployments requiring higher concurrency, the database layer can be easily migrated to PostgreSQL or MySQL without changing the application logic.

### Authentication and Security

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide stateless authentication, allowing the API to scale horizontally without session storage requirements. The JWT implementation includes configurable expiration times and secure signing algorithms.

bcrypt handles password hashing with automatic salt generation, providing protection against rainbow table attacks and ensuring that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain secure.

### Additional Libraries

The application leverages several additional libraries to provide comprehensive functionality. The python-jose library handles JWT token creation and verification, while bcrypt manages password hashing. Pydantic provides data validation and serialization, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

CORS middleware enables cross-origin requests, making the API accessible from web applications hosted on different domains. This flexibility is essential for modern web application architectures.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing the Notes App API, ensure that your system meets the following requirements. Python 3.8 or higher must be installed, as the application uses modern Python features and type hints. A virtual environment tool such as venv or conda is recommended to isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts with other Python projects.

Git should be available for cloning the repository, and a text editor or IDE for code modification if needed. Basic familiarity with command-line operations is helpful for installation and testing procedures.

### Installation Process

The installation process begins with creating a suitable development environment. First, clone or download the project files to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

Create a virtual environment using the following command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, use:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux, use:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration, though default values are provided for development. The JWT secret key should be changed for production deployments to ensure security. The database file location can be configured, though the default SQLite file works well for development and testing.

For production deployments, consider setting the following environment variables:
- JWT_SECRET: A secure random string for JWT token signing
- DATABASE_URL: Database connection string (if migrating from SQLite)
- CORS_ORIGINS: Specific origins allowed for CORS requests

### Database Initialization

The application automatically initializes the database schema on first startup. The init_db() function creates the necessary tables if they don't exist, ensuring a smooth setup process. No manual database configuration is required for basic operation.

The database initialization creates two main tables: users for storing user account information and notes for storing note data with proper foreign key relationships. The schema is designed to be simple yet extensible for future enhancements.

### Running the Application

Start the development server using uvicorn:
```bash
python main.py
```

Alternatively, use uvicorn directly:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000, with automatic API documentation accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs.

## Authentication and Security

### JWT Token Implementation

The application implements JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication, providing scalability and security benefits. JWT tokens contain encoded user information and are signed with a secret key to prevent tampering.

Token generation occurs during the login process, where user credentials are verified against the database. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is created with the user ID as the subject and an expiration time of 24 hours. The token is signed using the HS256 algorithm with a configurable secret key.

Token verification happens on every protected endpoint through the get_current_user dependency. The middleware extracts the token from the Authorization header, verifies its signature and expiration, and extracts the user ID for use in subsequent operations.

### Password Security

Password security is implemented through industry-standard bcrypt hashing with automatic salt generation. When users register or change passwords, the plain text password is never stored in the database. Instead, bcrypt generates a unique salt and creates a hash that is computationally expensive to reverse.

The hashing process uses a configurable work factor that determines the computational cost of hashing. This approach provides protection against rainbow table attacks and makes brute force attacks impractical even if the database is compromised.

Password verification during login compares the provided password against the stored hash using bcrypt's verification function, ensuring that passwords are never transmitted or stored in plain text.

### Access Control

Access control is implemented at multiple levels to ensure comprehensive security. At the endpoint level, authentication middleware verifies that requests include valid JWT tokens. At the data level, database queries include user ID filters to ensure users can only access their own data.

The application implements ownership-based access control, where users can only perform operations on resources they own. This is enforced through database queries that include the authenticated user's ID as a filter condition.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow requests from web applications while maintaining security. The CORS configuration can be customized for production deployments to restrict access to specific domains.

### Security Best Practices

The application follows several security best practices to ensure robust protection. Input validation is performed at multiple levels, including Pydantic model validation and database parameter binding. This approach prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.

Error handling is designed to avoid information leakage while providing useful feedback to legitimate users. Authentication errors return generic messages that don't reveal whether a username exists, preventing user enumeration attacks.

Database queries use parameterized statements exclusively, preventing SQL injection attacks. The SQLite database file should be protected with appropriate file system permissions in production deployments.

## Database Schema

### Users Table

The users table stores account information for all registered users. This table serves as the foundation for authentication and access control throughout the application.

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- id: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer identifier
- username: Unique username for login, cannot be null
- email: Unique email address, cannot be null
- password_hash: bcrypt hash of the user's password
- created_at: Timestamp of account creation, automatically set

**Constraints and Indexes:**
- Primary key on id field for efficient lookups
- Unique constraints on username and email prevent duplicates
- Automatic timestamp generation for created_at field

### Notes Table

The notes table stores all note data with proper relationships to users. This table implements the core functionality of the application.

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
)
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- id: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer identifier
- title: Note title, cannot be null
- content: Note content, cannot be null
- user_id: Foreign key reference to users table
- created_at: Timestamp of note creation, automatically set
- updated_at: Timestamp of last modification, automatically set

**Relationships:**
- Foreign key relationship with users table ensures referential integrity
- One-to-many relationship: one user can have many notes
- Cascade behavior can be configured for user deletion scenarios

### Database Design Considerations

The database schema is designed for simplicity and efficiency while maintaining data integrity. The use of integer primary keys provides optimal performance for joins and lookups. Automatic timestamp generation ensures consistent time tracking without requiring application-level management.

The foreign key relationship between notes and users ensures that orphaned notes cannot exist in the database. This design supports future enhancements such as note sharing or collaborative features.

Index considerations include the primary keys on both tables and the foreign key relationship. Additional indexes could be added for common query patterns, such as searching notes by title or content.

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes

The application uses standard HTTP status codes to communicate the results of API operations. This approach ensures compatibility with HTTP clients and provides clear indication of success or failure conditions.

**Success Codes:**
- 200 OK: Successful GET, PUT, DELETE operations
- 201 Created: Successful POST operations that create new resources

**Client Error Codes:**
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid input data or business rule violations
- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid authentication credentials
- 403 Forbidden: Valid authentication but insufficient permissions
- 404 Not Found: Requested resource does not exist
- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Valid JSON but invalid data format

**Server Error Codes:**
- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server-side errors

### Error Response Format

All error responses follow a consistent JSON format that provides clear information about the problem while avoiding sensitive information disclosure.

**Standard Error Response:**
```json
{
    "detail": "Error description"
}
```

**Validation Error Response:**
```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "loc": ["field_name"],
            "msg": "Field validation error",
            "type": "validation_error"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy that balances user experience with security considerations. FastAPI's automatic validation provides detailed error messages for malformed requests while preventing invalid data from reaching the business logic.

Authentication errors are handled consistently to prevent information leakage. Failed login attempts return generic error messages that don't reveal whether a username exists in the system, preventing user enumeration attacks.

Database errors are caught and converted to appropriate HTTP responses, ensuring that internal database details are not exposed to clients. Connection errors and constraint violations are handled gracefully with user-friendly error messages.

### Logging and Monitoring

Error logging is implemented to capture important events for debugging and monitoring purposes. The application logs authentication failures, database errors, and unexpected exceptions while avoiding sensitive information in log messages.

Production deployments should implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track API usage, error rates, and performance metrics. This information is valuable for maintaining system health and identifying potential security issues.

## Testing

### Test Strategy

The application includes comprehensive testing capabilities through the provided test script. The testing approach covers all major functionality including user registration, authentication, and full CRUD operations for notes management.

The test script demonstrates proper API usage and can serve as both validation and documentation for client developers. It includes error handling to provide clear feedback when the API is not running or encounters issues.

### Test Coverage
